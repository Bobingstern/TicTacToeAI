# TicTacToeAI
A DDQN that learned to play tic tac toe (Knots and Crosses) by playing against itself

Currently the AI is really bad and it prioritizes blocking the opponent from winning rather than winning itself. I'll try to retrain it using different rewards to see how it turns out. You can play against is here https://bobingstern.github.io/TicTacToeAI/tfjs_app/index.html
